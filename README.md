# x86-chrome-33-installer

Since Google has discontinued their properitary Chrome 
application for 32 bit versions of Linux. 

I have taken the time to create a script that installs chrome 
and its dependency requirements. 

Libcurl4 is dropped and libcurl3 is required to install chrome 33.

Do you find it useful?
